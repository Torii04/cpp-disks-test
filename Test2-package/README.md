## Main Description
This simulation shows the random movement of disks within a box. Each disk has the same radius and clashes with each other disk, such that they do not overlap. It is presented on a matplotlib plot, with units on both axis, and runs for 1000 frames, however this can be adjusted in main.cpp.

## Adaptations
- Allowed visualisation compatibility with vscode.
- Disks stay within the box

## Navigation Using GIT
In order to view the commit history, the code:

`git log --oneline --graph --all`

In order to check differences between versions:

`git diff HEAD~1`

Using the tags, it is possible to checkout versions easily:
`git tag` lists all the tags; `git checkout <tag>` takes you to that version.
